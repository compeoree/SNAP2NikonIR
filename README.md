# SNAP2NikonIR
A full project (mechanical, electrical, software) clone/upgrade of the Nikon ML-L3 IR remote.

It functions in two ways:
1) Simple ML-L3 clone - press the button to trigger the shutter
2) A SNAP to IR interface

SNAP is a method to capture photos using a compatible camera and certain astromony mounts/hardware. It is typically wired, which Nikon cameras do not support. This device will convert the SNAP standard 2.5mm audio TRS connector to an IR signal.

A battery is required and the selected CR1632 should last around 18 months.
